          <p>
            4.1 You warrant that any information that you provide to us in order to provide you with
            a Quote to perform the Services or to estimate the resources required to fulfil our
            Services is accurate and not misleading in any way.

            4.3 You warrant that the Goods do not include any fire arms or goods that are, or may
            become, dangerous, corrosive, highly combustible, explosive, damaging or noxious in
            nature (Dangerous Goods), unless you have first notified us in writing and we then agree
            to carry the Goods.
          </p>
          <p>4.4 We may, at our sole discretion, refuse to remove or carry Dangerous Goods.</p>
          <p>
            4.5 In the event that we discover any Dangerous Goods after the Goods have been received
            by us, we reserve the right to take any reasonable action, including destruction or
            disposal of the Dangerous Goods, without incurring any liability to you.
          </p>

          <h3>Fragile and valuable goods</h3>
          <p>
            4.6 Prior to the removal of any Goods, you must provide us with written notice of any
            Goods that may be fragile or that comprise jewellery, precious items, works of art,
            money, collections of items or precision equipment (Special Items).
          </p>

          <h3>Goods left behind or removed in error</h3>
          <p>
            4.7 You will ensure that all Goods to be removed for carriage are uplifted by Moving
            Again and that none are taken in error.

          <p>
            4.8 You, or a person representing you, must be present at the times of loading and
            unloading the Goods.

            person who you authorise in writing to receive the Goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2 If we are unable to deliver the Goods because there is no authorised person to
            receive them on our arrival or because we cannot gain access to the premises on which
            the Goods are to be delivered, or any other reason beyond our control, we may unload the
            Goods into a warehouse and will be entitled to charge you an additional amount for
            storage of the goods and for the re-delivery of the Goods to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.3 We will not be liable for any delays for reasons out of our control, including

          </p>

          <h3>Variation of Services</h3>
          <p>
            7.2 In the event that information that you provide to us is incorrect, inadequate,
            inaccurate or varies after we have provided you with a Quote, Moving Again may, in its
            sole discretion, perform the Services as specified in a Quote or vary the charges in
            accordance with the variation in the specified quantity, volume or weight of the Goods,
            plus any variation in time taken to perform the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            7.2a You understand that all prices are provided under the assumption that we are able
            to safely and legally access both pickup and delivery with a semi-trailer or similarly
            sized large removal truck. If your move has to be quoted with use of a smaller vehicle
            it will be explicitly mentioned on your quotation.
          </p>
          <p>
            7.3 Storage charges are per week, and are payable monthly in advance. Charges are

            7.3 You agree that where the loading or unloading process is delayed by over 30 minutes
            of the time contained in a Quote due to any factor outside the control of Moving Again,
            you must pay an additional charge that will be calculated in accordance with the Charge
            Rate.
          </p>

          <h3>Cancellation of Services</h3>
          <p>
            7.4 In the event that you cancel the Services within 48 hours of the date that we have

            the following amounts:

              Time spent by Moving Again, including its Sub-contractors, in either arranging and/or

              cancellation of the Services.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            7.5 In the event that you cancel the Services more than 48 hours in advance of the dates
            that we have agreed to arrive for the pick up, Moving Again reserves the right to charge
            you an administration fee to cover time and costs associated with your booking of the
            Services.

            7.6 You agree to reimburse Moving Again for any costs, fees or taxes incurred by us in

            addition to the amounts that we provide in any Quote.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is 8. Payment?</h2>
          <p>
            8.1 Moving Again will provide you with an invoice for the Services at the time of
            loading the Goods and you must pay at that time in the form of cash, credit card or
            other acceptable method of non-reversible electronic funds transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.2 In the event that Moving Again incurs additional charges in connection with

            provides you with at the time of unloading the Goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.3 Moving Again may assign its rights to a third party to collect all charges and
            payments from you in connection with the Services.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Lien on Goods</h2>
          <p>
            9.1 All Goods received by us, and that belong to you, shall be subject to a general lien

          </p>
          <p>
            9.3 In the event that any amount remains outstanding for a period of 28 days, we may
            give seven (7) days' written notice to you of our intention to sell the Goods and of the
            outstanding amount is not paid within that period, we may sell all or any of the Goods
            by public auction or otherwise and apply the net proceeds as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, to pay all costs, commissions and expenses associated with the sale of the
              Goods;

              Second, to pay any storage fees incurred in retaining, storing or otherwise holding
              the Goods;
            </li>
            <li>Third, to pay all invoices provided by Moving Again or a Sub-contractor; and</li>
            <li>
              The balance of proceeds of sale (if any) be forwarded to you by way of bank cheque at
              the address that you supply to us at the time of contracting with us to perform the
              Services.
            </li>
          </ul>

            10.1 Except where the Services are required by you for the purposes of a business,
            trade, profession or occupation in which you are engaged, these terms and conditions
            will be subject to the guarantees set out in sections 60, 61 and 62 of the Australian
            Consumer Law being, in particular, a guarantee that the services will be performed with

            and carriage. We will not be liable for damage or disorder, unless such damage or

          <h3>Maximum value of the Goods</h3>
          <p>
            10.5 In any claim for loss or damage under this clause 10, any estimate of the value of

            </li>
            <li>
              in satisfaction of any claim, we repair or replace the Goods or other property without
              liability for depreciation and in that event, our liability will not exceed the cost
