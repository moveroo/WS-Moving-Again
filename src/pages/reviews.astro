    title: 'Great value for a big move',
    review:
      "We had about 25 cubic metres to move from Brisbane to Melbourne. The backloading option saved us a fair bit compared to dedicated trucks. Pickup was within the 48-hour window they mentioned—they gave us a day's notice which was fine. Everything arrived in good condition about 6 days later. Communication was good throughout.",

    title: 'Good service, took a bit longer than expected',
    review:
      'Cross-country move to Perth. The price was very competitive—about 40% less than other quotes we got. Took about 10 days which was a couple days longer than the estimate, but they kept us updated. Minor scuff on one piece of furniture but nothing major. Would use again for the savings.',

    title: 'Smooth and straightforward',
    review:
      'Small move, just a 2-bedroom unit worth of stuff. Quoted online, got a response same day. Picked up on Tuesday, delivered Friday. No dramas at all. The guys who delivered were professional and quick. Good experience.',

    title: 'Finally found reliable removalists',
    review:
      'After a bad experience with another company years ago, I was nervous about interstate moving. Moving Again were upfront about everything—transit times, insurance, what to expect. Quote was accurate, no hidden fees. My furniture made the trip safely. The online quote system made it easy to adjust my inventory as I packed.',

    rating: 4,
    title: 'Decent price, professional service',
    review:
      'We compared a few removalist quotes and Moving Again was mid-range but seemed more transparent. The 48-hour pickup window worked for us since we had some flexibility. Took 5 days door to door. Only giving 4 stars because we had to chase up a delivery time confirmation, but otherwise no complaints.',

    title: 'Stress-free cross-country move',
    review:
      'Moving across the country for work was daunting but these guys made it easy. The quote process was simple—I listed everything online and they came back with a price. Used the backloading option which took about 9 days. Everything arrived as expected. Would recommend.',

      'Needed to transport my car while I flew down to Melbourne. Got a quote online, car was collected the following week. Arrived about 5 days later with no issues. Door-to-door service was convenient. Price was fair.',

    title: 'Long haul but worth it',
    review:
      'Big move from Far North QLD to Sydney. We knew it would take a while given the distance. They were clear about the timeframe upfront which we appreciated. Took about 8 days. A couple of boxes ended up in the wrong room but that was a labelling issue on our end. Overall happy with the service.',
