  {
    question: 'How much can I save with backloading?',
    answer:
      'On average, customers save 40-60% compared to dedicated truck moves. The exact savings depend on your move size, route, timing flexibility, and current truck availability. Popular routes like Sydney-Melbourne typically offer the best savings due to high truck volumes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does backloading take?',
    answer:
      "Backloading typically takes 2-7 business days depending on the route. Direct routes (e.g., Sydney-Brisbane) are faster (2-4 days), while cross-country routes (e.g., Perth-Sydney) take 5-7 days. We'll give you a delivery window when you book.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my furniture safe with backloading?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Your items are professionally wrapped, secured with straps, and separated from other loads using steel partitions. All moves include transit insurance (covering fire, collision, overturning). For complete protection including breakage and handling damage, we recommend full moving insurance from movinginsurance.com.au.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What can I move with backloading?',
    answer:
      "Most household furniture, boxes, and appliances. We can transport fridges, washing machines, beds, sofas, and fragile items. We can't transport hazardous materials, live plants, or perishable food. Ask us about car transport for vehicles.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get a quote?',
    answer:
      'Use our online quote form or call us. We need your pickup and delivery addresses (suburbs), an inventory list or approximate cubic meter volume, and your preferred pickup window. Quotes are free and delivered within 2 hours during business hours.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if my items are damaged?',
    answer:
      "Transit insurance (included via our contractors) covers fire, collision, and overturning only. For breakage or handling damage, you'll need full moving insurance. We strongly recommend getting a policy from movinginsurance.com.au before your move. Document any issues immediately on delivery with photos.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I choose a specific delivery date?',
    answer:
      "Backloading works best with flexibility—that's where the savings come from. If you need a specific date, ask about our premium options, though this reduces the cost savings.",
  },

    question: 'How is backloading priced?',

  <!-- What Is Backloading -->
  <section class="py-16 bg-white">

      <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-8 text-center">What Is Backloading?</h2>

        <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto">
          <p>
            Backloading is the transport industry's smartest secret. Every day, hundreds of removal
            trucks travel interstate carrying furniture. After they deliver, they need to
            return—often empty. That's wasted fuel, wasted capacity, and wasted money.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Backloading solves this.</strong> Instead of paying for a dedicated truck (and its
            empty return journey), you share space on a truck already heading your way. The driver fills
            their return journey, you pay a fraction of the cost, and everyone wins—including the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like carpooling, but for your furniture. You're not getting a lesser
            service—you're getting the same professional removalists, the same insurance, the same
            care—just at a smarter price.

            Backloading is priced by <strong>cubic meter (m³)</strong>—the volume your items take up
