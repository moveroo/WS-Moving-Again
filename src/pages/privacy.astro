            our authorised personnel.
          </p>

          <h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            In our business, personal information may be stored both electronically and in hard-copy
            form. We are committed to keeping your personal information secure regardless of the

            from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
            However, you use the Website at your own risk and we accept no responsibility in the
            event of a breach of your privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that no information transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed to be
            completely secure. However, we will endeavour to protect your personal information as
            best as possible but we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you
            transmit to us, or receive from us. The transmission and exchange of information is
            carried out at your own risk.
          </p>

          <h2>Accuracy and Quality of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that all information requested
            from you is kept accurate, up to date and complete.
          </p>

          <h2>Access to Your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            In most cases, you have the right to access the personal information that we hold about
            you. Please contact our Privacy Officer at <a
              href="mailto:admin@movingagain.biz"
              class="text-brand-red hover:underline">admin@movingagain.biz</a
            > if you wish to access your personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will deal with all requests for access to personal information as quickly as
            possible. Requests for a large amount of information, or information which is not
            currently in use, may require further time before a response can be given.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may charge you a fee for access if a cost is incurred by us in order to retrieve your
            information, but in no case will we charge you a fee for your application for access.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, we will refuse to give you access to personal information we hold about
            you. This includes, but is not limited to, circumstances where giving you access would:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>be unlawful;</li>
            <li>have an unreasonable impact on other people's privacy;</li>
            <li>prejudice an investigation of unlawful activity;</li>
            <li>
              reveal our intentions in relation to negotiations with you so as to prejudice those
              negotiations;
            </li>
            <li>
              prejudice enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement
              body;
            </li>
            <li>
              reveal evaluative information generated within the Moving Again business in connection
              with a commercially sensitive decision-making process.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will also refuse access where the personal information relates to existing or
            anticipated legal proceedings, and the information would not be accessible by the
            process of discovery in those proceedings. Further, we will refuse access where your
            request is frivolous or vexatious.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we refuse to give you access we will provide you with reasons for our refusal, unless
            doing so would be unreasonable in the circumstances. We will also take reasonable steps
            to give you access in a way that meets your needs without giving rise to the reasons of
            our refusal. Further, we will provide details of how you may make a complaint about our
            decision.
          </p>

          <h2>Correction of Your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            The accuracy of the personal information we have requested from you is important to us.
            Should you suspect, or become aware of, that personal information we hold as a result of
            having requested it from you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete or misleading,
            please contact our Privacy Officer at <a

          </p>
          <p>
            We will deal with all requests for correction of personal information as quickly as
            possible. Requests relating to a large amount of information, or information which is
            not currently in use, may require further time before a response can be given.
